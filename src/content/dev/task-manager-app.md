# Task Manager Pro

A full-stack collaborative task management application that allows teams to organize, track, and complete projects together in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: See updates from team members instantly
- **Project Organization**: Organize tasks into projects and categories
- **User Management**: Invite team members and manage permissions
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and analytics
- **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications for important updates

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (React)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for predictable state updates
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io client for live collaboration
- **UI Components**: Custom component library built with styled-components
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens

### Backend (Node.js)
- **API**: RESTful API built with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt for password hashing
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling file attachments

## Architecture Decisions

### Why MongoDB?
The flexible document structure works well for tasks that can have varying fields and nested comments.

### Why Socket.io?
Needed reliable real-time updates across different network conditions and fallback support for older browsers.
