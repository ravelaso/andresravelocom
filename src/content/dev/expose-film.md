# Expose Film

This is a work-in-progress mobile app.

If you shoot film, this app will help you meter the light for a correct exposure.
It takes your phone's camera correct exposure to read the settings used by your phone camera, then you can 
change the settings according to your film camera and the app will calculate for exposure.


You can have film rolls set up and track each frame you meter with the app to have a memorandum
of exposures through your rolls. You can always come back and check which camera settings you chose
for the camera.
