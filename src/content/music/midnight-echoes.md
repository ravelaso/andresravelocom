# Midnight Echoes

**Midnight Echoes** is an immersive ambient electronic piece that captures the essence of late-night urban landscapes. The track features layered synthesizers, subtle percussion, and field recordings from city streets after midnight.

## Inspiration

This track was inspired by those quiet moments walking through the city at night, when the usual chaos settles into a more contemplative rhythm. The sounds you hear in the background are actual recordings from my neighborhood at 2 AM.

- **DAW**: Ableton Live 11
- **Key Instruments**: Moog Sub 37, Roland Juno-106, Field recordings
- **Mixing**: Mixed in stereo with spatial audio techniques
- **Mastering**: Self-mastered with Ozone 9
